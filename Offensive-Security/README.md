# Offensive Security Labs

Welcome to the **Offensive-Security** repository! This repository contains a collection of labs I've completed focusing on offensive security and practice. The labs cover various aspects of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation.

## üìù Overview

This repository includes practical exercises that I have worked on during my offensive security training. The content covers a variety of topics, including:

- **Reconnaissance** 
- **Network Scanning**
- **Metasploit**
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Post-Exploitation**

## üíª Labs

### 1. [Exploring Key Linux Commands for Penetration Testing](./Offensive-Security/Exploring%20Key%20Linux%20Commands%20for%20Penetration%20Testing.pdf)
- **Objective**: This lab demonstrates various key Linux commands and their applications for penetration testing.

### 2. [Network Scans](./Offensive-Security/NetworkScans.pdf)
- **Objective**: The objective of this lab was to perform different types of network scans and analyze the results using network scanning tools.

### 3. [Passive Reconnaissance of Purdue.edu](./Offensive-Security/Passive%20Reconnaissance%20of%20Purdue.edu.pdf)
- **Objective**: The objective of this report was to perform initial passive reconnaissance of the target domain purdue.edu using passive tools and techniques.

### 4. [Password Cracking and Hash Analysis - Techniques and Time Estimates](./Offensive-Security/Password%20Cracking%20and%20Hash%20Analysis%20-%20Techniques%20and%20Time%20Estimates.pdf)
- **Objective**: The objective was to use password cracking tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper, as well as use Crunch and CeWL to create wordlists for cracking hashed passwords and estimating the time required to crack them.

### 5. [Using Metasploit](./Offensive-Security/Using%20Metasploit.pdf)
- **Objective**: The purpose of this lab is to develop and execute exploits against a remote machine, in this case, Metasploitable 2, using Metasploit.

### 6. [Sample Pentest Report](./Offensive-Security/SamplePentest.pdf)
- **Objective**: This report is about a penetration test I conducted as part of a group on a small network aimed at compromising a workstation and domain controller, using Kali boxes from April 15 to April 29th.
