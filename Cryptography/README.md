## Tools & Techniques

These labs explore a variety of cryptographic tools and techniques such as:

- **OpenSSL**: A toolkit for the implementation of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, widely used for generating encryption keys, performing cryptographic operations, and testing cryptographic algorithms.
- **HMAC**: A cryptographic construction used for message authentication, combining a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to verify both the data integrity and authenticity of a message.
- **One-Time Pad**: A theoretically unbreakable encryption method that uses a key that is as long as the message itself, used for securely encrypting sensitive data.

## Learning Goals

- Understanding the core concepts behind classical and modern cryptographic techniques.
- Learning how to implement encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Gaining experience in working with OpenSSL for encryption tasks.
- Understanding the security implications of various cryptographic methods.
