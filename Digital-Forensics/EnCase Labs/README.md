# Digital Forensics Cloud Labs

**Welcome**! This directory contains a series of screenshots and documentation from hands-on, immersive virtual labs provided by **Jones & Bartlett Learning**. These labs are part of the **Digital Forensics, Investigation, and Response + Cloud Labs** material, designed to give students a real-world experience of conducting digital forensics and incident response investigations within fully functional IT infrastructures. The screenshots showcase the steps and techniques involved in these labs, which cover key areas like forensic evidence recovery, incident response, and system memory analysis.

The labs provide an interactive and comprehensive approach to learning digital forensics and security, simulating real-world IT environments without putting institutional assets at risk. These labs are a great way to practice critical cybersecurity skills and prepare for future roles in the field.
